# Bicycle Color Scheme

* This repo is for a single web page for designing bicycle color schemes.
* The illustration, taken from https://freesvg.org/road-bike, was enriched with
selection sets using [inkscape](https://inkscape.org). 
* Designs can be shared via a [web share
  polyfill](https://github.com/NascHQ/share-api-polyfill).
* Images can be downloaded in [scalable vector
  graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) format for
further improvement.
